Tests are located in test/assettracker.js

There are total of 9 tests.  The first 7 tests that were written were testing all the basic functionality as far as make sure the functions were as expected.  I wrote some tests to verify events were emitted since on the UI we have callback functions when those events are called. 

The last 2 tests I created were more specific cases that I discovered bugs through the UI so I made sure to cover those cases to make sure there were no regression errors.
